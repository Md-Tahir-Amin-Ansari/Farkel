    <h1>About</h1>
    <div>Hello! My name is Md. Tahir Amin Ansari, and this project is
        a digital adaptation of the classic dice game, Farkle.
        I developed it as a way to practice my JavaScript skills and
        to better understand game development concepts.
    </div>
    <div>
        The inspiration for this project came from a version of Farkle
        featured in the game Kingdom Come: Deliverance (KCD). I loved
        the strategic yet simple gameplay and wanted to recreate that
        experience while adding my own twist with custom scoring rules.
    </div>
    <div>
        This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and
        I used WebStorm IDE for development. It includes features like:
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>A custom scoring system tailored for a fun and unique gameplay experience.</li>
        <li>An interactive user interface designed to be intuitive and visually appealing.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Future Plans</h3>
    <div>In the future, I‚Äôd love to expand this project with features like:</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Multiplayer functionality (both local and online).</li>
        <li>Animations for dice rolls and scoring updates.</li>
        <li>A scoring history feature to track progress.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Feedback and Collaboration</h3>
    <div>
        If you have suggestions, feedback, or ideas for collaboration, feel free to reach out! You can also check out the source code for this project on GitHub.
        <br>
        Thank you for checking out my project, and I hope you enjoy playing this version of Farkle as much as I enjoyed creating it!
